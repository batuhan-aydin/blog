1. [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/?fbclid=IwAR1NEIiwwk-e2k3ykSTrxF5YkrLshitO3ZK_BlnbtG9_FWtpu2Vb0w78OZY)

This is an very good open course about learning some helpful tools and bash scripting that can help you throughout in your career. However, bash was a little challenging at first, it's a little different than modern programming languages. I suggest Shell Scripting with Bash course from Pluralsight, also there are tons of other free sources anyway.
